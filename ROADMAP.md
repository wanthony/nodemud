# NodeMud Roadmap

This file contains a general roadmap for NodeMud releases.

### Pre v0.1

Anything tagged pre v0.1 (releases in the v0.0 line) are pre-alpha releases.  At this stage, the project is in its infancy and still has a ways to go before it can be considered stable in any way.

I would like to see the following features in the pre-alpha releases:

- Basic chat functionality
	- Authenticated users from a MongoDB database
	- The server should handle basic IRC-like commands
	- User access levels
	
### Alpha v0.1

The first alpha release should include the following features:

- Chat rooms
	- I see these eventually becoming MUD "rooms"
- Simple styled messages
- Basic character creation
